      "message": "This is coming from an aggregate file that contains the \"rpm -qa\" from all weirdo jobs, for example:\n\n    https://logs.rdoproject.org/95/7595/4/experimental/gate-weirdo-dlrn-master-puppet-scenario003/Z8e2bbd62cfd24b88a70db552cc88a61f/rpm_packages.txt.gz\n\nThis aggregate file is then passed through this script:\n\n    https://github.com/rdo-infra/review.rdoproject.org-config/blob/master/nodepool/scripts/filter_packages.sh\n\nExcerpt from the documentation header:\n# The script:\n#  1) Resolves the package names from the rpm -qa output\n#  2) Blacklists verbatim matches in blacklisted repositories (RDO and release_packages)\n#  3) Blacklists packages which requires blacklisted packages\n#  4) Filters the initial list of packages against the comprehensive blacklist\n#  5) Provides a list of packages that is *only* available on CentOS base repos\n#     and does not require packages which are found in blacklisted repositories\n\nBasically, it ensures that the packages in this list:\n- Are not mirrored by RDO and SIG repositories\n- Do not require the installation of a package that is in a RDO or SIG repository\n\nThe script isn\u0027t super finished yet, IIRC I need to do a final \"sort |Â uniq\" on the end result and for some reason the centos-release-storage-common needs taken out.",
