      "message": "If you\u0027re going to be \"gating\" against an upstream project, you want to be using zuul-cloner, not a regular git clone.\n\nZuul-cloner allows you to clone a project *and* check out the patch you are meant to test.\nThis is done automatically by the \u0027prepare-workspace\u0027 builder [1].\n\nFor example, if the project is \u0027openstack/tripleo-quickstart\u0027 and a job triggers for it, it will automatically clone \u0027openstack/tripleo-quickstart\u0027 with the patchset.\nIf, however, you also need another project to be cloned in, potentially with a patchset as well (i.e, using Depends-On), you will need to \"manually\" zuul-clone that other project.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/rdo-infra/review.rdoproject.org-config/blob/ecac640de9105cfb6c81004fc0ea96d56f02f9e4/jobs/_default_jobs.yaml#L16-L43",
