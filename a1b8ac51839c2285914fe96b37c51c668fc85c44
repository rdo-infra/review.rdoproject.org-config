Also, if this job fails, it means containers can no longer be built, are we okay with this ?\n\nThat job was introduced as a stopgap because there was no proper coverage in tripleo-common upstream. I would love to remove this if there is a job upstream that tests that containers do not fail to build as a result of a patch in tripleo-common.",
