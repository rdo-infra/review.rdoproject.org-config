      "message": "I\u0027ve been testing this script locally, and it tries to change all existing entries to the following, removing quotes around rpm-master:\n\n       - openstack/tempestconf-distgit:\n           zuul/include: []\n           repoxplorer/branches: [\"rpm-master\"]\n\nAdding \"preserve_quotes\u003dTrue\" to the yaml.load call on line 104 seems to avoid this. The only gotcha is that the new entry looks like the following:\n\n      - openstack/testclient-distgit:\n          zuul/include: []\n          repoxplorer/branches:\n          - rpm-master\n\nIf that\u0027s ok for you, I\u0027m fine with it.",
