      "message": "iiuc, this means that, if a new version does not exist in fedora, we\u0027ll skip it from the review in rdoinfo. Note that we want to get it in rdoinfo so that we can follow the required tasks to get it updated in fedora and deps (se my previous comment).\n\nAs an improvement, in those cases we may create two reviews in rdoinfo, one with the packages where nvr exist in fedora and a second one with the ones that does not exist in fedora. This second commit would be on top of the one with fedora rebuilds, and should have some info in the commit message alerting about those packages don\u0027t exist. Anyway, this is just an improvement, don\u0027t need to implement now.",
