      "message": "Just validating this number for the record:\n\nThe aggregate currently has 15 nodes at (probably) 48 cores and 256GB RAM each. This gives us 720 cores and ~4000GB RAM to work with.\n\nThe CPU overcommit ratio is currently at 1, though, so this limits us to 90 VMs (720 cores/8 vcpu flavors) while also leaving a huge amount of RAM unused (only using 720 out of 4000).\n\nFor the time being, 50 servers is a good number and it means we\u0027re left with ~40 VMs of headroom for OVB nodes which is more than enough.\n\nWe should consider bumping the CPU overcommit at least to 2 to get us 180 VMs without significant impact to the job performance while doubling our capacity. It still leaves us with ~1440GB RAM used out of ~4000GB but it\u0027s a better use of our hardware.",
