      "message": "That patch will not work, because you delete the current deployment and then you run start, without running \"setup\" command, so it will not work.\n\nCurrently, we are creating a CRC VM snapshot (for nested) or create bundle from the deployment (extracted), but all the things are done by using specified version: https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/software-factory/sf-infra/+/refs/heads/master/roles/extra/crc/defaults/main.yaml#21 . With that way, we save at least 30-40 minutes to start a CI job and we have less possibility that the job will fail (sometimes the CRC mirror is slow, sometimes the CRC deployment fails etc). So if you want to create an image with other CRC release, I suggest to create another image and create new nodeset and base job.\n\nOr maybe I don\u0027t understand your needs, so if you can explain me more your needs?",

Maybe it will not break the job, but it is not necessary to run).\n\nNormally I don\u0027t have anything against including many bundles version into the CRC image, so we don\u0027t need to download the bundle each time in the job, but just use the --bundle parameter to setup the CRC, but still, it will require some refactor in crc role and base crc job and it would have a side effect: the images would be huge and the extracted version would be not possible to do.",
