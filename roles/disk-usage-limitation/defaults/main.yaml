# NOTE: We based on example requirements for etcd
# https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/hardware/
# The etcd service is on ramdisk, so it is not related to it, but
# we need to limit the job usage, due some jobs are affecting others, so
# even openshift apiserver got healthcheck issues and in the kubelet
# there is a message:
#
#   kubelet may be retrying requests that are timing out in CRI-O due to system load.
