Currently it\u0027s one role promote-consistent-to-tripleo-ci-testing with number of files that are called separately.\n\nroles:\n    - { role: promote-consistent-to-tripleo-ci-testing, tags: copy_from_workspace, other_tag }\n\n\nThen in the promote-consistent-to-tripleo-ci-testing:\n\n- name: Copy files from {{ workspace }} on node\n  synchronize:\n     [...]\n  tags: copy_from_workspace\n\nThere is just one gotcha if other playbooks were using the promote-consistent-to-tripleo-ci-testing and had already included the role, in this case better off keeping current implementation.",
