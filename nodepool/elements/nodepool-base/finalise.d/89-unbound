# You'd think rc.local would be simple ...
#
# On Redhat systems, systemd's rc-local service looks for an
# executable /etc/rc.d/rc.local file to run.  On Debian/Ubuntu, the
# eqivalent file is /etc/rc.local.
#
# Centos' systemd package symlinks /etc/rc.local to /etc/rc.d/rc.local
# correctly. Fedora, however, does not come with an rc.local file at
# all.  Thus if we have a rc.d directory, but no rc.local file, we
# need to create it (if you don't have an rc.d directory, and don't
# have /etc/rc.local, then it's not clear what platform you are on).
#
# Bug [1] is filed to bring Fedora in-line with Centos, and has more
# details on all this.  As at 2016-10-18 is unresolved.
