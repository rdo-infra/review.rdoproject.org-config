      "message": "there is still some debate over what the \"stable\" branch will be called but we will likely keep  18.0.0-proposed  as the stable branch for the entirety of 18.0.0\n\nThe exact workflow for this is still being discussed but its we will probably need to have slightly different ci jobs running on 18.0.0-proposed vs main as at some point main will not be using stable/antelope and shoudl move to deploying master\n\nwe need to dicuss the time line for that too but ideally before the end of the year or early next year main will need to be deploying master",
