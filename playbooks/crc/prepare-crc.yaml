# NOTE: This is just a new layer that will be dropped after
# migration from crc-extracted to crc-cloud is done.
# To avoid unexpected complication and many pull requests
# that will be failing because of missmatch for nodesets
# in parents and in child (e.g. parent would be crc-cloud where
# child is overwriting nodeset to crc-extracted, so all the
# other (childs) nodesets needs to be updated in the same time),
# we create such base "layer".
