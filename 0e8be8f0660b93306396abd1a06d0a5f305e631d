The aodh-distgit project (and the rest in this file) do not use the package-distgit-check-jobs job, so we would effectively have no check/build job for it.\n\nI think that, rather than removing newton-distgit-cbs-validate, we should add the mitaka and ocata jobs here as well. They\u0027ll be filtered out if not needed.",
